## Project Overview
This is a machine learning project designed to detect spam emails. The aim of the project is to explore the different ways that this project can be implemented. For the first section, we shall use simple machine learning models from Scikit-learn such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Demo
The demo app is being hosted on Streamlit. Follow the link: [https://](https://)

### Run Locally
To run locally, install the required packages from the requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the application on Streamlit.
2. Enter an email to check whether or not it's spam
3. Select a model from the dropdown.
4. Click run model

## Roadmap
- [x] Create the simple ML Models: Linear Regression, SVM, and Random Forest
- [ ] Use Streamlit to host the application
- [ ] Finetune Llama-3 for spam email detection
